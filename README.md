# üêç Snake

A classic Snake Game implemented in `pygame-ce`.  
The player controls a snake that grows longer each time it eats food. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the window boundaries.

This project demonstrates real-time rendering, collision detection, keyboard event handling, and simple game logic ‚Äî all implemented with clean Python code.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Classic Gameplay**
  - Control the snake using arrow keys.
  - Grow longer by eating food.
  - Avoid collisions with walls and yourself.

- **Dynamic Food Spawning**
  - Food appears at random positions.
  - Food never overlaps with the snake‚Äôs body.

- **Scoring System**
  - The snake‚Äôs length reflects your score.
  - Final score is displayed when the game ends.

- **Restart System**
  - Press `SPACE` after death to instantly restart.

- **Configurable Settings**
  - Adjustable speed, frame rate, growth rate, and window dimensions. (Easily configurable in the code)
